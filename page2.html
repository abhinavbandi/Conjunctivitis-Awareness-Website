			<center><p> Conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye, is an infectious condition caused by various factors including viruses, bacteria, and allergens. The majority of individuals with conjunctivitis experience mild symptoms such as redness, irritation, and discharge from the eyes. Usually, the condition resolves without the need for specific treatment. However, individuals with compromised immune systems or underlying eye conditions are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. The most effective approach to prevent and manage the spread of conjunctivitis is by educating oneself about the condition, its progression, and modes of transmission. Regular handwashing and proper eye hygiene play a crucial role in safeguarding against conjunctivitis. Additionally, refraining from touching the eyes with unwashed hands is recommended to minimize the risk of infection.</p><br>
			<p> Conjunctivitis is typically transmitted through direct contact with eye secretions or exposure to contaminated surfaces. It's crucial to observe proper eye hygiene and take preventive measures, such as avoiding touching the eyes with unwashed hands.</p></center>
